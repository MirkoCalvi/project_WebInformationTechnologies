# project_WebInformationTechnologies

## description

I have done this project during the second semester of the third year of Computer Science bachelor degree at Politecnico of Milan.
I liked a lot the course, Prof. Fraternali give us a detailed view of both frontend and backend web development. 
You will find two versions of the website, HTML and JS, a SQL configuration document and the backend Java code.
The graphic is pretty basic, but it wasn't the aim of the course. I focused my effort on the BackEnd and SQL database.
Read the powerpoint for more details.
